Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

In this project, we will be using Python to scrape data from web pages and perform data analysis on the collected data. We will be using the Splinter and Beautiful Soup libraries to automate browsing and parse HTML elements on web pages, respectively.
Steps

    Identify HTML elements on the web page that contain the data we want to scrape.
    Use Splinter to automate browsing and access the desired web page.
    Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML elements on the web page and extract the desired data.
    Organize and store the collected data in a structured format, such as a CSV or JSON file.
    Perform data analysis on the collected data using pandas and other relevant libraries.
    Visualize the insights gained from the data analysis using matplotlib, seaborn, or other relevant libraries.
